# 3. Discussion

The meeting focused on the need to define separate end of sales criteria for software and hardware,
emphasizing the importance of authoritative documentation from the provider and acknowledging
the complexity of hardware due to stock limitations.

* The meeting discussed the need to define the end of sales for software and hardware separately.
* There was a suggestion to start by defining solid definitions for full support, end of support, end of sales, and end of life.
* It was acknowledged that hardware and software have differences in terms of their end of sales, with hardware being more complex due to stock limitations.
* The participants agreed that focusing on smaller scopes and gradually expanding would lead to better definitions.
* The participants are discussing the need to define "end of sales" and "end of life" separately in the scope.
* They agree to remove the title of the scope that includes both terms.
* There is a discussion about how resellers may still sell products even after they are no longer available from the vendor.
* They discuss the importance of authoritative open EOX documents coming from the vendor, not resellers.
* The meeting discussed the definition of supply chain and clarified that even if a product is no longer available from the vendor, it may still be sold by others.
* There was a suggestion to replace the term "vendor" with "provider" to make the definition more general.
* The team discussed prioritizing the next steps in defining end of life and end of sales for software and hardware products.
