# 3. Discussion

## 3.1 GitHub Issues for Discussion

* Issues
  * Przemyslaw updated [lifecycle schema proposal #15](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openeox/issues/15)

## 3.2 Review pending Pull Requests

* [Information Model example #24](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openeox/pull/24)
  * Omar presents the proposal (David Kemp is not present due to public holiday in US)
  * Thomas Schmidt sees much more complexity and not much improvement
  * Przemyslaw seconds and adds tha deriving YAML from the JSON is trivial
  * Stefan Hagen adds as previously discussed:
    * the target OpenEOX data model will be nearly flat with simple types and not nested with difficult types
      so no big value assumed but high cost in readability
    * JSON schema 2020-12 is matching OpenAPI 3.1 so implementers already get a good start and JSON is easy to transcribe
      in other data formats (for simple structures)
    * the abstraction may slow down provision of good use cases and examples as JSON has become a
      linua franca of the decade so members can fast provide, exchange, and analyze use cases and working code
    * open to revisit when we have a convincing work product to then see if we as editors can add the information
      model description based on e.g. JADN to maximize reach
  * Omar likes the idea to not follow the JADN route for now,
    but maybe revisit later when we have use cases and a working JSON data model
  * Przemyslaw will submit a motion per the TC mailing list
* [Create definitions.md #13](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openeox/pull/13)
  * All discuss the current state of the proposal and how to proceed best 
  * Expectation management is that we will not find terms that will be perfect for all vendors
    as many vendors already use terms in an uncoordinated and sales oriented way
  * Pablo articulates that an important outcome should be that the customer may still have to deal with 5 different
    support tiers but he can map these to a simple end of life model without being forced to learn the life cycle
    of every vendor first.
  * Przemyslaw asks if there are use cases where there are more than one tier applicable at one time for one product
  * Stefan mentions Ubuntu OS distribution versus security patches for select components only offered for a pro tier
  * All discuss what to map to end of support as an example as to how to apply a unified schema onto complete endpoint
    system environment
  * Sonny mentions a delivery with soft- and hardware components evolving along different life cycles - maybe
    not able to see this always as a single endpoint
  * Omar demonstrates as example a system hardware that contains Red Hat Enterprise Linux and an OpenSSL version not
    supported by Red Hat inside and shows how he tried to embody this in the PR #13
  * Omar will continue to work on the PR #13
* [BSI scenarios #26](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openeox/pull/26)
  * Thomas Schmidt shortly presents the use case templates from BSI to receive feedback from the TC
    with the goal that everyone else can use these templates to describe their use cases / scenarios
    in an easy to compare and combine way
  * All agree to review the contributions from the outside in and only provide formal suggestions that optimize comparability
    (not discuss the content of scenarios of other suppliers)
  * Omar suggests that he and his team take a look and we follow this shallow verification approach to collect
    the needed data fast and then take time to discuss the combination of the provided use cases / scenarios
    * No objections, all in favor
