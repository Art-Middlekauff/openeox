# 3. Discussion

The meeting focused on creating definitions for end of sales and end of life, including the need for a generic definition that covers both hardware and software.

* The team discussed creating a definition for software and hardware end of sales, and decided to use one broader definition that covers both scenarios.
* They identified the need to define the term "vendor" and discussed integrating the concept of "product family" into the schema.
* There was a suggestion to use "May" instead of "can" in the standard, and questions were raised about whether cloud services should be covered by open UX.
* There is a concern about random CNAs reporting vulnerabilities without discussing them with project maintainers.
* The definition of "vendor" is being discussed, including the need for an official list and entity claiming product IDs.
* The end of sales definition excludes open-source projects without sales, and downstream providers may have different end of sales dates.
* The definition of "end of sales" should include the last order date, which is more important for customers.
* When a company is acquired or changes ownership, they should update their open UX documents to reflect the change.
* The end of sales definition should apply to both software and hardware.
* There are two types of end of life: one where someone doesn't want to continue and one where they are unable to continue.
* The meeting discussed the need for a generic end of life definition that covers both hardware and software.
* The team agreed to remove the software part from the proposed definition and focus on a generic end of life definition.
