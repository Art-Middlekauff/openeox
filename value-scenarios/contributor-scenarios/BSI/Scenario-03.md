### Used definitions

- `product`: as defined in [CSAF](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/os/csaf-v2.0-os.html#12-terminology)
- `vendor`: as defined in [CSAF](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/os/csaf-v2.0-os.html#12-terminology)

### Description

As a consumer, I want to compare products of different vendors to inform my purchase decision from the aspect
of the lifecycle state the product is in.
For example, there is not point in introducing a new product that is already outdated or does not have support
anymore.
Therefore, it is crucial to have a common language across all vendors.
