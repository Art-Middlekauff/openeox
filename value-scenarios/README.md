# Value Scenarios
This directory is scenarios showing scenarios
which show the value of some aspect of EoX.

There are two subdirectories:
* contributor-scenarios
* general-scenarios

The contributor-scenarios directory is for 
organizations to put in scenarios showing 
the needs of their organization.
Contributors should submit scenarios based on their own experiences and not on behalf of others.
Each organization should have their own subdirectory
in the contributor-scenarios directory.
Organizations can not refute the needs of other organizations.
E.g. you can not say 'that scenario is not valid' -
instead could say 'that scenario does not apply to my organization'.

The general-scenarios directory is for scenarios
that the group has reached consensus 
are worth being in our agreed body of work.
These scenarios will be written using fictious organizations.
